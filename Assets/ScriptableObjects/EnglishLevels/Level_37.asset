  Dialog:
    _characterText: I met a girl, but I don't know how to win her. Tell me what to
      do? To be sure. I don't want to waste time. She so sweetly forgets her things
      everywhere...
    _predictorText: Don't worry, the brilliance of your life has already attracted
      her. Just don't make a fire, it won't help.
