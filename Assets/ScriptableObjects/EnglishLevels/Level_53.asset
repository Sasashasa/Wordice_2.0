  Dialog:
    _characterText: Hello. I'm afraid for my life. Yes! I think they want to poison
      me! I don't know yet who and why, but I haven't been feeling very well lately.
      Believe me! My life is definitely in danger!
    _predictorText: I believe and see that your life is really in danger. But nobody
      wants to poison you. Fat will ruin you, and your wife and salads will save
      her.
