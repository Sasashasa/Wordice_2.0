  Dialog:
    _characterText: The guy and I have been fighting a lot lately. And I think he
      was fascinated by our mutual friend. Tell me, how can I fix it?
    _predictorText: You see correctly, you are not the fault of these quarrels. There
      is a line on your door, almost invisible. Replace the door and locks, then
      there will be no more quarrels, because the reason will go away.
