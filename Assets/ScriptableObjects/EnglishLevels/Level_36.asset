    _characterText: I have a younger daughter. Lives far away, with a man. I'm worried
      about her, but I'm afraid to ask. So, honey, tell me, how is she there? I'm
      very worried.
    _predictorText: And worry, Mother, it's right. Only not sadness awaits you, but
      joy. Her braid will be unwound soon.
