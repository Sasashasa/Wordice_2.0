  Dialog:
    _characterText: Hello, fortune teller. I didn't want to come, but my wife insisted
      too much. She thinks... uh... thinks I'm cheating on her. Imagine, ha! He doesn't
      believe me, so maybe he'll listen to you?
    _predictorText: She'll listen to me, but it won't do you any good. Because sleep
      is the place where you betray your marriage regularly.
