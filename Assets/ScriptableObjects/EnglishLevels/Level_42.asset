  Dialog:
    _characterText: My husband started coming home late. And the money flies away
      to no one knows where. I'm afraid to follow him. And I don't want to blame
      him, because he's... good. What should I do, tell me.
    _predictorText: To love, since you have such a fate. And if you want to find
      out where the money goes, so don't go home from work, but look first at the
      bar, there are answers to all your questions.
