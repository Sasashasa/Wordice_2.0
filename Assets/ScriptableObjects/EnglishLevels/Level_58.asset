    _characterText: "My wife... she\u2026 She's good, really. Sometimes demanding,
      but... I love her! But yesterday\u2026 She was clearly hinting that something
      had changed in her. And I do not know what! She didn't like my silence at all.
      Help! I need to know exactly what the change is, otherwise..."
    _predictorText: I'll help you with your trouble. When she comes home today, she
      will have a bag in her hands. I will help you in what you did not ask for.
      Think about the fact that not only your wife should change.
