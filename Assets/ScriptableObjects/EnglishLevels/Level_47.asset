    _characterText: I'm conducting an investigation, so please - no one should know
      about our meeting. We have been trying to nail the gang leader for a long time,
      but he is careful and leaves no traces. You are my last hope.
    _predictorText: Look in his house. He loves traveling, and the leg, one of the
      three that hold the globe of the earth, will help you.
